 More Pandas

## **What the assignment was about:**
The assignment was about using more advanced commands in Pandas to analyze data.

## **Something I learned in the process:**
I learnt how to merge two datasets together, how to match part of a column using dropna(subset=['Column]) and str.contains(), how to drop columns, how to use na=False to not include missing data, how to use .replace and np.nan to convert an object into a number, and how to plot histograms on top of one another. For the last one, I also learnt that we needed to run the two codes on the same line otherwise it doesn't work!

## **Something I found challenging:**
There were *a lot* of new things! How to fill in empty columns using .fillna("", inplace=True) is useful, but I will need more practice to remember it. Ditto for .isin. I learnt how to make a bar graph of the top five breeds in each borough with the help of a TA, but there were four new concepts packed in and I didn't quite understand how everything worked.
